            Hello there. My name is Praise. I am a front-end developer based in
            Lagos, Nigeria. I have more than a year of experience building
            frontend web applications. I am proficient in technologies such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I intend to transition
            into full stack development, so I am currently learning backend
            technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and Django. I am seeking out
            opportunities to broaden my skill sets and improve as a developer. I
            am committed to solving problems and developing topÂ innovations.
          </p>
